# Uber-Repairs-Stations-using-K-means-and-GMM-Models

Uber, a unicorn in transportation services, has been at the forefront of transforming urban transportation system, offering countless individuals a seamless and immediate travel solution, while providing a “gig work” platform to those who seek employment. By operating in strategic locations globally, Uber's business has produced a lot of data, including geographic, customer behavior and preferences, presenting an opportunity for in-depth analysis and business refinement. 

In this research paper, our focus is centered on Uber’s Operations in New York City, a dynamic epicenter for Uber's business. Our aim is to tap into this rich data reservoir to unearth insights that promises to improve the flow of Business in NYC by suggesting methods to improve bottlenecks associated to Uber Drivers’ cars breaking down. To grasp the nuances of Uber's New York operations, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration of diverse data streams, using geographic data to find ideal locations to set up Service Stations. It's worth noting that Uber's footprint extends to over 900 urban hubs worldwide. The crux of this initiative is to predict cab pickups using the k-means clustering technique and Gaussian Mixture Model, a method that categorizes the data into 'k' distinct segments, with 'k' being user-specified.
The important packages used in the project are pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN, sklearn.neighbors.BallTree, geopy.distance.great_circle, sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split."
